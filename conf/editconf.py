# This is a helper tool for editing configuration files during the setup
# process. The tool is given new values for settings as command-line
# arguments. It comments-out existing setting values in the configuration
# file and adds new values either after their former location or at the
# end.
#
# The configuration file has settings that look like:
#
# NAME=VALUE
#
# If the -s option is given, then space becomes the delimiter, i.e.:
#
# NAME VALUE
#
# If the -c option is given, then the supplied character becomes the comment character
#
# If the -w option is given, then setting lines continue onto following
# lines while the lines start with whitespace, e.g.:
#
# NAME VAL
#   UE
